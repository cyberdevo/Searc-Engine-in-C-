# Searc-Engine-in-C++


Hi,
This Project is based upon data structures and algorithnms in which 

Linked list is used for Extraction of data

after extracting data it compares to user query

data from file extracted by linked list == given query

if query words are found in data than it counts a frequancy of each word

after calculating frequacy 

it ranks the document according to the frequancy 

if Doc3 contains more frequancy than Doc0 than 

it ranked on Top like web pages on #Google
